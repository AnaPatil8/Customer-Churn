# Customer-Churn
This project aims to analyze and predict customer churn using machine learning models. It includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, and interpretation using SHAP values.

## 🔍 Dataset

- `customerchurn.csv` – Contains customer behavior and demographics (e.g., tenure, services used, contract type, churn flag).

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- Python
- pandas, numpy
- matplotlib, seaborn
- scikit-learn
- SHAP

## 📈 Project Workflow

1. Load and explore the dataset
2. Clean and preprocess the data
3. Perform EDA to understand churn patterns
4. Encode categorical features and scale numerical features
5. Train classification models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree)
6. Evaluate model performance (accuracy, ROC-AUC)
7. Interpret model using SHAP values
